 Tasks:
1. Identify the specific line(s) causing the bug:

The logic is mostly correct, but not a bug per se.
However, it silently consumes the queues (q1, q2) and alters the original inputs.
It also assumes q1 and q2 are deques and not regular lists or Queue.


2. Why this causes incorrect behavior (edge case):

If the function is expected not to modify original queues, this breaks that contract.
